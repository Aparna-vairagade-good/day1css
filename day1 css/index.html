    <h1>1.difference between flex row and column</h1>
    <p>Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.</p>
    <p>Short Answer - .row is only a container for grid col. However, flex-row, flex-column, etc.. can be used for any flexbox elements (not just the grid rows and columns).</p>
   <p>The flexbox direction utility classes can be used to responsively change the direction of flexbox children (regardless of the children being grid columns or other content). There are 4 flexbox directions: row, row-reverse, column and column-reverse</p>
   <h2>2.explain inline internal and external stylesheet</h2>
   <p>Inline CSS: Requires the style attribute placed inside an HTML element. Internal CSS: Requires the (style) element placed inside the head section of an HTML file. External CSS: Requires the (link) element placed inside the head section of an HTML </p>
<p> Internal or embedded ⁠— add (style) tag in the (head) section of HTML document. External ⁠— link the HTML sheet to a separate . css file. Inline ⁠— apply CSS rules for specific elements.</p>
<h2>3.justify-content allows you to do what?</h2>
<p>The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.</p>
<p>The justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. It defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.</p>
<h2>4.Difference between absolute and relative positioning.</h2>
<p>position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.</p>
<p>Absolute change also refers to the change in the indicator in percentage points, i.e. value of the indicator in period 2 minus that in period 1. Relative change also refers to the change in the indicator in percentage terms, i.e. absolute change as a percentage of the value of the indicator in period 1.</p>
<h2>5.What is grid-template-columns used for?</h2>
<P>The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.</P>
<p>The grid-template CSS property is a shorthand property for defining grid columns, grid rows, and grid areas.</p>
<p>What does 1fr mean in the following code? grid-template-columns: 150px 150px 1fr 1fr; The first two columns will be two fraction units of the stated width. The third and fourth columns is 1 fraction unit of the remaining space in the grid.</p>
<p>Grids make it easier for designers to collaborate on designs by providing a plan for where to place elements. Grid systems help to decouple work on interface design because multiple designers can work on different parts of the layout, knowing that their work will be seamlessly integrated and consistent.</p>
<h2>6.What is the z-index in css?</h2>
<p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
<p>The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.</p>
<h2>7.What is difference between margin and padding?</h2>
<p>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.</p>
<p>S.No. Margin is the space outside of the component's edge or border. Padding is the space inside of the component's edge or border.</p>
